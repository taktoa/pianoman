# ### Commentary:
# #
# # When building PianoMan via Nix, this file has '@'-enclosed names replaced
# # by their Nix values. For example, if default.nix contains,
# #
# #     # ...
# #     stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
# #       # ...
# #       foo = "bar";
# #       # ...
# #     }
# #
# # then any instances of '@foo@' will be replaced by 'bar'.
# #
# # Obviously, this is a fairly easy-to-use interface for anyone looking to
# # build PianoMan in other ways; just use your favorite regex tool or copy the
# # definition of substituteAllInPlace from the Nixpkgs source code.
